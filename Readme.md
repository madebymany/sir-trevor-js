# Sir Trevor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/madebymany/sir-trevor-js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/)

Existing WYSIWYG content editors were designed for immutable display media. In contrast, Sir Trevor is rich content editing entirely re-imagined for the web: an intuitive editor for web content which does not presuppose anything about how it will be rendered.

It believes in three guiding principles:

- **Display-neutrality**: content must be stored in a clean, structured and standards-based format
- **Technology agnosticism**: act as an abstraction layer on top of any technology which can render HTML
- **Extensibility**: the interface must be easily extended to include input mechanics for any web-based artefact

## Customising

We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for our styles, if you'd like to change the default styling please fork the repository and [make changes to the Sass](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/wiki/Customising-the-default-styling) before recompiling. Alternatively, you can override the base styles with your own CSS.

Block Types can also easily be added to the ``SirTrevor.Blocks`` object. You can also override the defaulty block types (Text, Image, Tweet, Video, Quote, Heading & List) at any time. Please see the Wiki article about [adding your own block types](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/wiki/Creating%20your%20own%20Block%20types) for more information.

## Dependencies
