# Blocks

## Tweet Block

To use the Tweet block you'll need some **server side** code. This will need to lookup a Tweet ID and return the tweet in JSON via the Twitter API. Unfortunately, the only way to do this via the API is with an authenticated call.

You can change the Tweet fetch URL as follows:

    SirTrevor.setBlockOptions("Tweet", {
      fetchUrl: function(tweetID) {
        return "/tweets/?tweet_id=" + tweetID;
      }
    });

## Image Block

The image block relies on a server side component to **store images on the server**. By default Sir Trevor will do an AJAX file upload in the background to a `/attachments` endpoint. You can change this as follows:

    SirTrevor.setDefaults({
      uploadUrl: "/images"
    });

The uploader posts an `attachment` hash that has three properties:

  * `attachment[name]` – the files name
  * `attachment[file]` – the file
  * `attachment[uid]` – a unique identifier for this file

For an uploader example, using Rails + Carrierwave [please see here](https://gist.github.com/cjbell88/7091537).

## Hooks

There are a few hook in points per block that you can use:

**`beforeBlockRender`**
Called immediately when render is called.

    SirTrevor.Blocks.Text.beforeBlockRender = function() {
      alert('Do something');
    };

**`onBlockRender`**
Called once a block has been rendered.

    SirTrevor.Blocks.Text.onBlockRender = function() {
      alert('Do something');
    };

## Events

We use an event model to trigger actions, which can be hooked into if necessary. The events given off are as follows:

<a name="3-4-1"></a>
### Block Events

* `block:create:new`
* `block:create:existing`
* `block:remove`
* `block:reorder:dropped`

<a name="3-4-2"></a>
### Formatter

* `formatter:hide`
* `formatter:position`

<a name="3-4-3"></a>
### Upload Events

* `onUploadStart`
* `onUploadStop`
* `onError`

You can use these events using the `SirTrevor.EventBus` as follows:

    SirTrevor.EventBus.on('block:create:new', function(){
      console.log(arguments);
    });
